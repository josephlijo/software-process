# Overview
An effort to learn and gather software development process, principles, practices, tools and technologies.

## Difference between Process, Principle, Pattern, Methodology, Model, Paradigm, frameworks, tools

## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

## CI/CD - Continuous Integration, Deployment, Delivery

## Software Architecture

## Concurrency and Parallelism

- **Concurrency** means that two or more tasks are making progress even though they might not be executing simultaneously; **Parallelism** on the other hand arise when the execution is truly simultaneous.

### Patterns and Models
- [Actor Model](./software-architecture/design-patterns/actor-model)
