# Java and C# language comparison

## Java
- The Java technology is both a **programming language** and **a platform**
- Java programming language
    - Is Object-oriented
    - Has C-like syntax
    - Portable across Operating systems
- Java platform
    - Is a particular environment where Java applications are run
    - Four platforms: 
        - **Java SE (Standard Edition)** - **Core platform and libraries**, defines basic types to high-level classes, JVM, JDK
        - **Java ME (Micro Edition)** - Subset of SE **for mobile devices**, small-footprint JVM, **useful for IoT (Internet of Things)**
        - **Java FX (eff-ects)** - For creating **Rich Internet Applications (RIA**), has User-interface API, has hardware accelerated graphics for high performance clients
        - **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)** - **extends SE** providing an API and runtime environment for developing and running enterprise software - networking, web-services, scalable, reliable, secure application development. Has API's to handle transactions, persistence, messaging, etc. thus allowing developers to focus on business requirements. 
    - All platforms consists of `Java Virtual Machine (JVM)` and a set of API's
    - The JVM is a program for a particular operating system and hardware that runs Java applications
    - API is a base set of software components which helps create your own app
- Java platforms comes with JVM, development tools, deployment and monitoring tools - called `Java Development Toolkit (JDK)`
- Java SE, ME, and FX applications are often clients of Java EE applications
- Enterprise applications are applications which are multi-tiered, scalable, reliable and secure - Java EE is used to create such applications.
