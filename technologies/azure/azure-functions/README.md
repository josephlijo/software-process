# Azure functions

- A `serverless` technology.
- Let's us run a `handler function` in case of an `event`
- These `events` are **triggered** by a variety of inputs such as **HTTP** and **Queues**

## What is serverless?
- Serverless computing is a abstraction of servers, infrastructure and operating system.
- With Serverless apps, we don't need to provision and manage servers.
- Serverless computing is driven by the reaction to events and triggers happening in near-real time in cloud.
